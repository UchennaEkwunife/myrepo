**Adventure Game Engine**

This project is an adventure story game. The player navigates through a story by making
choices at certain points, which can change the outcome of the story.

**What Each File Is For**
1. Adventure.py: This is the python program that functions as the heart of our project! It
contains the main classes and functions that make our game run.
2. story1.json: This is our json file which contains the narrative of the game. It's loaded in
Adventure.py to provide the content for your adventure.
3. README.pdf: That's this file! It provides a guide to our project and instructions on how
to play the game.

**Running the Game**
Open up your terminal or command line.
To run our game, type this: python Adventure.py story1.json
The format of our command line argument is “python_python file_file story.” Use python3 if you
are running this on Mac.

**Playing our adventure game!**
After you start the game you'll be asked to enter your name and see the story start to appear. As
the story goes on, you'll have to make choices in order to stay alive. What you choose changes
where the story goes, so choose wisely! The game ends when the story reaches an ending point.
You are then shown a bar chart that represents the number of times each choice is made in the
story defined in the “story1.json” file. You can replay the game as many times as you want.
